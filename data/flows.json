Environments (e.g. dev, prod) and packages (e.g. istio) can be fully configured to suit the deployment needs.\"\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Remove all prior content for podinfo from your cluster. \n\n## Recommended Reading\n- https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/big-bang/bigbang/-/blob/master/README.md\n\n## Objective\nYou will be creating a kustomize directory and applying it through `kubetcl -k` or `kustomize build ...`. This folder should not be in the bigbang charts directory or any subdirectory.\n\nThis can be accomplished without kustomize if preferred. The only requirement for how is that you do not modify the bigbang chart.\n\n### Minimum Requirements\n- Namespace\n- GitRepository\n- HelmRelease\n- VirtualService\n\nThis would meet the bare minimum requirements.\n\n## Recommended Requirements\n- Setting podinfo values via kustomize\n  - This can be done via `spec/valuesfrom` in `HelmRelease`\n  - An example would be using a `configmap` that kustomize created with `configMapGenerator`\n\nThere is one 'issue' with the above, kustomize doesn't know about HelmRelease since it's a CRD. When kustomize creates a configmap it appends a hash to it based on the contents of the resource, so the references to the configmap need to have the hash as well. With base k8s resources kustomize will automatically change the references. With a HelmRelease though, as stated above, it won't know what to change. This is remedied by using a kustomize configuration file that includes `nameReference`. This syntax/usage is described at https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/transformerconfigs/README.md#name-reference-transformer.\n\n## Success Criteria\nAfter applying the resources to the cluster, podinfo should be deployed and accessible through the istio gateway via podinfo.bigbang.dev",

This guide assumes that you have not changed this, if you have change references to `.zshrc` to your shell's equivalent.\n```\necho 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n# Generate your GPG Key\n```\ngpg --full-generate-key\n```\n- `RSA` and `RSA`\n- `4096` key size\n- No expiration (unless you want one)\n- Enter real name or github username\n- Enter github email address, can be any authorized email on your account but MUST match one\n- Comment can be anything including being empty\n\n# Add GPG Key to GitHub\n```\ngpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG\n```\nThe part you want to copy is the string following `sec rsa4096/`. Copy that string into this command over the Xs.\n```\ngpg --armor --export XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX | pbcopy\n```\nThat command will have copied your public key to your clipboard. This can be pasted into the \"Create new GPG key\" wizard on github.com.\n\n# Configure Git To Sign Commits\nThey key id used above is also used in the git config to tell git which GPG key to use for signing.\n```\ngit config --global user.signingkey XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n```\nThis command is necessary so git knows which gpg binary to run.\n```\ngit config --global gpg.program=/opt/homebrew/bin/gpg\n```\nIf you always want all commits to be signed you can run this command as well\n```\ngit config --global commit.gpgsign true\n```\n\nYou may enable \"vigilant mode\" on github.com so that any unsigned commits are marked as unverified.",
